# Maven License Validator Plugin #

A maven plugin which allows a maven artifact to enforce licensing restrictions on its dependencies in a flexible manner, in order to avoid accidental licensing violations through dependency inclusion, including transitive dependencies.

The detailed instructions on how to use this plugin can be found in the [documentation](http://maven-license-validator-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/site/index.html)

The wagon is available from the Maven Central, thanks to Sonatype [OSS Repository Hosting](https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide).
